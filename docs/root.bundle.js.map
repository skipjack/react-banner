The props listed below can be used to tweak, change, and respond to the **functionality** offered by this component. To change the **layout** and **color scheme** we recommend extending or forking the base stylesheet.\\n\\n## Supported Props\\n\\n#### blockName (string)\\n\\nThis package follows [BEM naming conventions][1]. If you are doing a lot of custom styling or otherwise require control of the base name for all css classes, go ahead and use this option to alter the base class. \\n\\n> **Warning:** This requires that you fork the stylesheet and update all classes there as well.\\n\\n#### className (string)\\n\\nAdds an additional class to the root `<header>` element.\\n\\n#### logo (node)\\n\\nThe image, text, or whatever else you may want to display in the left section of the banner.\\n\\n#### url (string)\\n\\nThe current url, used to determine which link (or links) is active. If you're building a normal site it's enough to just pass `window.location.pathname`, with [react-router][2] `this.props.location.pathname` would also work.\\n\\n#### link (component)\\n\\nThe component used for routing and displaying links. See the **Custom Links** section below for more details.\\n\\n#### links (array)\\n\\nThe data used to generate the navigation links. Pass an array of objects that conform to the spec in **Link Data** below.\\n\\n#### search (boolean)\\n\\nPass `false` to turn off the search bar.\\n\\n#### onMenuClick (function)\\n\\nA callback fired whenever the mobile (\\\"hamburger\\\") menu button is clicked.\\n\\n#### onSearch (function)\\n\\nA callback fired whenever the user submits a search.\\n\\n#### onSearchTyping (function)\\n\\nA callback fired every time the user types in the search field.\\n\\n\\n## Link Data\\n\\nEach link object **MUST** contain `title` and `url` properties. This component will also handle the first level of `children` link objects by displaying a secondary navigation menu under the main banner. Any more levels of nested `children` would have to be handled using a custom link component (described above) or in another part of your site. Here's an example of a valid link object:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    title: 'Example',\\n    url: '/example',\\n    children: [ ... ] // Optional\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote that anything renderable is allowed in the link's `title` prop, e.g. the following code would allow you to render an icon in place of text (using JSX):\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    title: <i className=\\\"icon-github\\\" />,\\n    url: 'https://github.com'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> **Note:** The icon code shown above is dependent on having an icon font available (e.g. [font awesome][6]). However you could also render a full SVG, component, or anything else in the same manner.\\n\\n\\n## Custom Links\\n\\nPassing a custom link component can be an easy way to extend the navigation section of the banner. For example, you could pass a custom component that acts as a dropdown to render `children` if your site contains a large amount of pages.\\n\\nThere are two pre-built link components provided in the `/src/links` directory: `StandardLink` being the default while `SPALink` can be used for single page applications using react-router (like this site, for example). The data from each link object, described below, is spread onto this component as props as well as a BEM element class name and active modifier class (if the link is active). \\n\\nThe two components above, however, are more for demonstration purposes and not very customizable. We recommend creating your own link component, using the [two defaults][3] for inspiration. For example, you could use HTML5 history API manually:\\n\\n```js\\n// ... import dependencies and such\\n\\nclass CustomLink extends React.Component {\\n    render() {\\n        let { index, url, ...otherProps } = this.props\\n\\n        return (\\n            <a \\n                { ...otherProps } \\n                href={ index || url }\\n                onClick={ this._navigate.bind(this, index || url)>\\n                { props.children }\\n            </a>\\n        )\\n    }\\n\\n    _navigate(url = '', event) {\\n        if ( !url.match(/^https?:/) ) {\\n            event.preventDefault()\\n            history.pushState({\\n                some: 'state'\\n            }, 'MyTitle', url)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nexport default props => {\\n    return (\\n        <Banner\\n            logo=\\\"My Logo\\\"\\n            url={ window.location.pathname }\\n            link={ CustomLink } // Pass our custom link component\\n            links={[\\n                { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Example Link\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/example\\\" },\\n                { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Another\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/another\\\" },\\n                { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Link w/ Children\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children\\\", \\\"children\\\": [\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"John\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/john\\\" },\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Jill\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/jill\\\" },\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Jack\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/jack\\\" }\\n                ]}\\n            ]} />\\n    )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> **Note:** If all you'd like to customize is the styling of links, there is no need to pass a custom component. Simply fork and edit the stylesheet as you wish.\\n\\n\\n## The Stylesheet\\n\\nThis component comes with a [base stylesheet][4] that is meant to be forked and extended. Most people will at least need to change the color scheme to match their own branding. We encourage you to tweak the layout to suit your needs as well but will only officially support the base stylesheet provided. Most minor layout changes should be fine, but changing the layout of bits like the search bar could cause some funkiness.\\n\\nBelow are some design variations people have come up with.

You'll need to store your main content element and pass it as the `parent` prop to `<Headroom>`. See the [main component][3] used to generate this documentation for an example.\\n\\nFor more details please see the headroom component's [documentation][1].\\n\\n\\n[1]: https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-headroom\\n[2]: ./integration/sidebar\\n[3]: https://github.com/skipjack/react-banner/blob/master/src/site/site.jsx\"\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 146 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"**React Banner** is a react component for generating banners (or \\\"navigation bars\\\") like one displayed above.

The props listed below can be used to tweak, change, and respond to the **functionality** offered by this component. To change the **layout** and **color scheme** we recommend extending or forking the base stylesheet.\\n\\n## Supported Props\\n\\n#### blockName (string)\\n\\nThis package follows [BEM naming conventions][1]. If you are doing a lot of custom styling or otherwise require control of the base name for all css classes, go ahead and use this option to alter the base class. \\n\\n> **Warning:** This requires that you fork the stylesheet and update all classes there as well.\\n\\n#### className (string)\\n\\nAdds an additional class to the root `<header>` element.\\n\\n#### logo (node)\\n\\nThe image, text, or whatever else you may want to display in the left section of the banner.\\n\\n#### url (string)\\n\\nThe current url, used to determine which link (or links) is active. If you're building a normal site it's enough to just pass `window.location.pathname`, with [react-router][2] `this.props.location.pathname` would also work.\\n\\n#### link (component)\\n\\nThe component used for routing and displaying links. See the **Custom Links** section below for more details.\\n\\n#### links (array)\\n\\nThe data used to generate the navigation links. Pass an array of objects that conform to the spec in **Link Data** below.\\n\\n#### search (boolean)\\n\\nPass `false` to turn off the search bar.\\n\\n#### onMenuClick (function)\\n\\nA callback fired whenever the mobile (\\\"hamburger\\\") menu button is clicked.\\n\\n#### onSearch (function)\\n\\nA callback fired whenever the user submits a search.\\n\\n#### onSearchTyping (function)\\n\\nA callback fired every time the user types in the search field.\\n\\n\\n## Link Data\\n\\nEach link object **MUST** contain `title` and `url` properties. This component will also handle the first level of `children` link objects by displaying a secondary navigation menu under the main banner. Any more levels of nested `children` would have to be handled using a custom link component (described above) or in another part of your site. Here's an example of a valid link object:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    title: 'Example',\\n    url: '/example',\\n    children: [ ... ] // Optional\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote that anything renderable is allowed in the link's `title` prop, e.g. the following code would allow you to render an icon in place of text (using JSX):\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    title: <i className=\\\"icon-github\\\" />,\\n    url: 'https://github.com'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> **Note:** The icon code shown above is dependent on having an icon font available (e.g. [font awesome][6]). However you could also render a full SVG, component, or anything else in the same manner.\\n\\n\\n## Custom Links\\n\\nPassing a custom link component can be an easy way to extend the navigation section of the banner. For example, you could pass a custom component that acts as a dropdown to render `children` if your site contains a large amount of pages.\\n\\nThere are two pre-built link components provided in the `/src/links` directory: `StandardLink` being the default while `SPALink` can be used for single page applications using react-router (like this site, for example). The data from each link object, described below, is spread onto this component as props as well as a BEM element class name and active modifier class (if the link is active). \\n\\nThe two components above, however, are more for demonstration purposes and not very customizable. We recommend creating your own link component, using the [two defaults][3] for inspiration. For example, you could use HTML5 history API manually:\\n\\n```js\\n// ... import dependencies and such\\n\\nclass CustomLink extends React.Component {\\n    render() {\\n        let { index, url, ...otherProps } = this.props\\n\\n        return (\\n            <a \\n                { ...otherProps } \\n                href={ index || url }\\n                onClick={ this._navigate.bind(this, index || url)>\\n                { props.children }\\n            </a>\\n        )\\n    }\\n\\n    _navigate(url = '', event) {\\n        if ( !url.match(/^https?:/) ) {\\n            event.preventDefault()\\n            history.pushState({\\n                some: 'state'\\n            }, 'MyTitle', url)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nexport default props => {\\n    return (\\n        <Banner\\n            logo=\\\"My Logo\\\"\\n            url={ window.location.pathname }\\n            link={ CustomLink } // Pass our custom link component\\n            links={[\\n                { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Example Link\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/example\\\" },\\n                { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Another\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/another\\\" },\\n                { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Link w/ Children\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children\\\", \\\"children\\\": [\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"John\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/john\\\" },\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Jill\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/jill\\\" },\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Jack\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/jack\\\" }\\n                ]}\\n            ]} />\\n    )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> **Note:** If all you'd like to customize is the styling of links, there is no need to pass a custom component. Simply fork and edit the stylesheet as you wish.\\n\\n\\n## The Stylesheet\\n\\nThis component comes with a [base stylesheet][4] that is meant to be forked and extended. Most people will at least need to change the color scheme to match their own branding. We encourage you to tweak the layout to suit your needs as well but will only officially support the base stylesheet provided. Most minor layout changes should be fine, but changing the layout of bits like the search bar could cause some funkiness.\\n\\nBelow are some design variations people have come up with. If you work some magic of your own please [ping me][5] and I'll add it to the list!\\n\\n> TODO: Add screenshots\\n\\n\\n[1]: http://getbem.com/naming/\\n[2]: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\\n[3]: https://github.com/skipjack/react-banner/tree/master/src/links\\n[4]: https://github.com/skipjack/react-banner/blob/master/dist/style.css\\n[5]: mailto:greg.venech@gmail.com\\n[6]: http://fontawesome.io/\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./site/content/customization.md\n// module id = 144\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"React Banner does not provide any built-in \\\"sticky-ness\\\" but can easily be integrated with things like [React Headroom][1] to achieve this behavior. In fact, that's exactly what we're using to implement the behavior on this site -- try scrolling on any page and notice how the banner fixes and unfixes itself to and from the top of the page.\\n\\n\\n## Basic Setup\\n\\nGoing forward with our original example, you would `npm install react-headroom --save` and update the code as such:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport React from 'react'\\nimport Banner from 'react-banner'\\nimport Headroom from 'react-headroom' // Import it\\nimport 'react-banner/dist/style.css'\\n\\nexport default props => {\\n    // Wrap it around your banner\\n    return (\\n        <Headroom>\\n            <Banner\\n                logo=\\\"My Logo\\\"\\n                url={ window.location.pathname }\\n                links={[\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Example Link\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/example\\\" },\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Another\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/another\\\" },\\n                    { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Link w/ Children\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children\\\", \\\"children\\\": [\\n                        { \\\"title\\\": \\\"John\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/john\\\" },\\n                        { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Jill\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/jill\\\" },\\n                        { \\\"title\\\": \\\"Jack\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/children/jack\\\" }\\n                    ]}\\n                ]} />\\n        </Headroom>\\n    )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Configuration with React Sidebar\\n\\nMaking this component play nicely with [react-sidebar][2] is a bit trickier but can still be done. You'll need to store your main content element and pass it as the `parent` prop to `<Headroom>`. See the [main component][3] used to generate this documentation for an example.\\n\\nFor more details please see the headroom component's [documentation][1].\\n\\n\\n[1]: https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-headroom\\n[2]: ./integration/sidebar\\n[3]: https://github.com/skipjack/react-banner/blob/master/src/site/site.jsx\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./site/content/headroom.md\n// module id = 145\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"**React Banner** is a react component for generating banners (or \\\"navigation bars\\\") like one displayed above.
